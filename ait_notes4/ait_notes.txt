MongoDB
- document store in bson (binary json)
- can be strings, numbers, other objects, arrays
- objectID is a unique identifier for documents
	- created for each document if "\_id" is not a key
- ie {title: zodiac, author: {first: neal, last: stephenson}}
- documents are key value pairs
- many docs are a collection and many collections can be in a database
- instance of running mognodb server can have multiple dbs
- `mongod` is the server and `mongosh` is the client
- can relate either with multiple collections and ids between the two or using subdocs
	- subdocs prioritize reads

Mongoose
